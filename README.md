# linapple-pie

This is a fork of Mark Ormonds Work:
https://github.com/dabonetn/linapple-pie

and used some code of Bill Chatfields fork (https://github.com/gungwald/applelin)
of the original linapple Projekt to make the ALT-Keys work as Open-Apple-Key.
It was too annoying to be unable to leave the Editor in later Merlin8 versions. :-)

Also the keymappings were modified to work better on PC keyboards with german layout.
